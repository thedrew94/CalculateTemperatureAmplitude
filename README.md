(Java Script) Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code is doing:

Define three arrays of temperatures: temperatureDayOne, temperatureDayTwo, and temperatureDayThree.
Define the calcTempForOneDay function, which takes an array of temperatures as its argument.
Inside the calcTempForOneDay function, define two variables max and min and initialize them to the first element in the array.
Start a for loop that iterates through each element in the array.
Inside the for loop, check if the current element is not a number using the typeof operator and the !== operator. If it is not a number, skip the rest of the loop body and move on to the next iteration using the continue statement.
If the current element is a number, compare it to the max and min variables using the ternary operator (? :) to update their values if necessary.
After the loop has completed, log the maximum and minimum temperatures to the console using console.log.
Return the temperature amplitude by subtracting the minimum temperature from the maximum temperature and store the result in a variable amplitudeOneDay.
Define the calcTempForTwoDays function, which takes two arrays of temperatures as its arguments.
Inside the calcTempForTwoDays function, use the concat method to combine the two arrays of temperatures into a single array.
Define two variables max and min and initialize them to the first element in the combined array.
Start a for loop that iterates through each element in the combined array.
Inside the for loop, check if the current element is not a number using the typeof operator and the !== operator. If it is not a number, skip the rest of the loop body and move on to the next iteration using the continue statement.
If the current element is a number, compare it to the max and min variables using the ternary operator (? :) to update their values if necessary.
After the loop has completed, log the maximum and minimum temperatures to the console using console.log.
Return the temperature amplitude by subtracting the minimum temperature from the maximum temperature and store the result in a variable amplitudeTwoDays.
Call the calcTempForOneDay function and pass in temperatureDayTwo as an argument. Log the result to the console using console.log.
Call the calcTempForTwoDays function and pass in temperatureDayOne and temperatureDayTwo as arguments. Log the result to the console using console.log.
